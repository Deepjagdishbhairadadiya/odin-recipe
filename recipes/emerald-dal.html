    <p><i>This <strong>Lentil Dal</strong> with Spinach Sauce is one of the most delicious, soul-satisfying plant-based, 
        Indian meals! This version is fragrant, flavorful and packed with nutrients- think of this like
        Saag Paneer,but substituting black lentils instead of the cheese! Super tasty and healthy.</i>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>onion and garlic</li>
        <li>ginger and chili pepper</li>
        <li>fresh spinach</li>
        <li>cumin seeds</li>
        <li>ghee or coconet oil</li>
        <li>lentils</li>
        <li>yogurt</li>
        <li>lemon or lime juice</li>
        <li>cooked basmati rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Chop the onion, garlic, ginger and chili pepper. If you like heat, add more chili pepper.</li>
        <li>Saute the onion garlic & chili pepper in ghee and add the spices. Feel free to use coconut oil, but ghee truly elevates this dish.</li>
        <li>Then add the fresh spinach, a little water, cover, and wilt over low heat for just a few minutes.</li>
        <li>A pound of spinach will wilt down into about 2 cups- if that. </li>
        <li>Blend the spinach sauce with a little water to form a spinach puree. It doesn‚Äôt need to be smooth unless you prefer it that way. Look how bright and green it is!</li>
        <li>Pour the spinach sauce back into the pan- and don‚Äôt overheat this or you will lose the gorgeous color!</li>
        <li>Then fold in the cooked lentils I add somewhere between 3-4 cups of cooked caviar lentils.  And I love these little black lentils most of all because they cook so quickly!!!</li>
        <li>i cook lentils using the pasta method. Cook in ample salted water until tender, then strain. That way you don‚Äôt have to have exact measurements with the water to lentil ratio. It is very forgiving!</li>
        <li>Using 3 cups of cooked lentils (instead of 4) will lend a ‚Äúsaucier‚Äù (more flavorful) dal which I prefer. But if you have 4 people in your family, I‚Äôd just add another cup of lentils. üôÇ</li>
        <li>Then stir in a little plain yogurt which will add creaminess and a touch of tanginess</li>
        <li>Taste. Adjust salt and heat to your liking. You want this slightly salty if serving over rice. A little squeeze of lemon or lime juice is nice here too!</li>
        <li>Remember, do not overheat the spinach lentil dal or you‚Äôll lose that lovely vibrant emerald color!</li>
        <li>At the same time as I‚Äôm making the dal- I‚Äôm also pan-searing naan bread, and cooking basmati rice to go with it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Spinach Lentil Dal- lovingly called Emerald Dal here at home‚Ä¶a simple and tasty combo that can be made in 30 minutes if you cook the lentils ahead!</p>
    <p>Yes, you can eat it like lentil soup if you prefer. üôÇ</p>
