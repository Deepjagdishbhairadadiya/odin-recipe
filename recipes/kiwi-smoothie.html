    <p>Kiwis are full of vitamins and nutrients – we try to get them in regularly. Here is a tasty <strong>Kiwi Smoothie</strong> we’ve been making! Kiwis can be quite tart, so be sure to let them ripen a bit before using them.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ui>
        <li>ripe kiwis</li>
        <li>avocado</li>
        <li>banana</li>
        <li>spinach or other greens</li>
        <li>plant-based milk, vanilla-flavored, is nice</li>
        <li>Sweetener of choice- maple, honey, agave, coconut sugar</li>
        <li>ice</li>
    </ui>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Never stick a spoon or spatula in a running blender.</li>
        <li>Pour the liquid in the blender first. Then add the fruit. This will help to get things moving.  Never, no matter what, add sticky or thick things like peanut butter in the blender first.</li>
        <li>Start the blender on the lowest speed and gradually increase the speed to high, and shut it down the same way, gradually slowing it down.</li>
        <li>Hold the blender lid firmly on– especially when starting and stoping the blender – if you do remove the lid while it is running, gradually reduce blender speed to lowest setting before turning it complexly off.</li>
        <li>If you can’t eat fresh fruit fast enough, freeze it for smoothies. (Peel it, cut it into small chunks, put it in a zip lock) Anything goes grapes, apples, kiwi, bananas, berries, oranges, mangoes, anything really. Avocados can even be frozen.</li>
        <li>In winter, add something hearty or rich like bananas, nut butters, tahini, oatmeal or avocado, for a little extra heartiness.</li>
        <li>A smoothie is not a milkshake. Try to keep it healthy. Otherwise, just have a milkshake.  Use soy, almond, rice or coconut milk, fruit or veggie juice, aloe or just water. Use maple syrup, brown rice syrup, honey, agave, or fruit itself,  as sweetener.</li>
        <li>Play around with adding fresh herbs and spices and seeds.</li>
        <li>Chilly frosty smoothies are yummy. Room-temperature smoothies are not as tasty. If not using any frozen fruit, throw in a few ice cubes. It makes it so much more palatable.</li>
        <li>If your smoothie is bland…try adding a little citrus juice, or zest to brighten up the flavor.</li>
    </ol>
